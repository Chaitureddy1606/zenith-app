## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

### MVVM Pattern
The feature follows Apple's recommended MVVM architecture:

- **Models** (`FinanceModels.swift`): Data structures and business logic
- **Views** (`FinanceViews.swift`): SwiftUI user interface components
- **ViewModels** (`FinanceManager.swift`): Business logic and state management
- **Supporting Views**: Reusable components and picker sheets

### State Management
- `@StateObject` for FinanceManager lifecycle
- `@EnvironmentObject` for dependency injection
- `@Published` properties for reactive updates
- Combine framework for data flow management

### Data Persistence
- UserDefaults for local storage
- Codable conformance for data serialization
- Automatic data saving and loading

## üì± User Interface

### Design Principles
- **Apple Human Interface Guidelines**: Following iOS design standards
- **8-Point Grid System**: Consistent spacing and alignment
- **Dynamic Type Support**: Adaptive typography for accessibility
- **Dark/Light Mode**: Full system theme support
- **Ultra-Thin Materials**: Modern glassmorphic design elements

### Accessibility Features
- VoiceOver support with descriptive labels
- High contrast mode compatibility
- Minimum 44√ó44pt tappable targets
- Semantic accessibility traits
- Comprehensive accessibility hints

### Responsive Design
- iPhone and iPad layout optimization
- Adaptive grid systems
- GeometryReader for dynamic sizing
- Safe area awareness

### Key Components

#### FinanceModels.swift
- `Transaction`: Core transaction data structure
- `Account`: Financial account representation
- `Budget`: Budget tracking and spending analysis
- `Bill`: Bill and subscription management
- `SavingsGoal`: Goal-based saving system
- `FinancialInsight`: AI-generated insights

#### FinanceManager.swift
- CRUD operations for all financial entities
- AI insight generation and analysis
- Data persistence and loading
- State management and updates
- Business logic implementation

#### FinanceViews.swift
- Main finance dashboard
- Summary cards and metrics
- Recent transactions list

- AI insights display

### Data Flow
1. User interacts with UI components
2. Views call FinanceManager methods
3. FinanceManager updates data and state
4. Published properties trigger UI updates
5. Data automatically persists to storage

## üéØ Usage Examples

### Adding a Transaction
```swift
// Create transaction
let transaction = Transaction(
    amount: 25.99,
    type: .expense,
    category: foodCategory,
    merchant: "Starbucks",
    date: Date(),
    account: checkingAccount,
    notes: "Morning coffee"
)

// Add to manager
financeManager.addTransaction(transaction)
```

### Setting Up a Budget
```swift
// Create budget
let budget = Budget(
    category: foodCategory,
    amount: 400.00,
    period: .monthly,
    startDate: Date(),
    spent: 0,
    isActive: true
)

// Add to manager
financeManager.addBudget(budget)
```

### Creating a Savings Goal
```swift
// Create savings goal
let goal = SavingsGoal(
    name: "Vacation Fund",
    targetAmount: 2000.00,
    currentAmount: 500.00,
    targetDate: Calendar.current.date(byAdding: .month, value: 6, to: Date()),
    category: travelCategory,
    notes: "Summer vacation to Europe",
    isActive: true,
    contributions: []
)

// Add to manager
financeManager.addSavingsGoal(goal)
```
